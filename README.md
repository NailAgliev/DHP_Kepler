As we have always been about the community first, we have decided to release this interface design as an open source design.  If there is demand, we will manufacture boards as needed; however, feel free to build on your own as well.  Please read the license agreement.  If you have issues / want to submit changes, please do so!

Over the coming weeks, firmware source and application software will be released to further help the DIY community!
