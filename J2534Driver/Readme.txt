The J2534 folder is a bit of a hot mess right now.  

High level, there are two separate projects, one that creates a native DLL and one for hte .NET functionality.  

Will provide more detail on how to use this stuff later as there are a few work arounds to make it work properly which need to be addressed in the code still.

Definitely will want some help to clean this one up.  

Tested VPW / CAN with SPS and other GM tools and it does work, though.  :)
